This is Goldmine, a Discord bot with many features, including music and cats. Check it out now!

# Moved
Goldmine was rewritten in Java. The new and modern version can be found here: https://github.com/kdrag0n/bluestone

Please note that selfbot mode is **not** supported, and will not be in the rewrite. However, this Python version is now completely unsupported. Use at your own risk.

- Commands: Too many to list.
- DM conversations: have some fun here :)
- Per-server bot name and command prefix :D
- Too many more to list.

# Installation
### Two-Click (Public Instance)
#### This is very easy, and offers the best performance and reliability overall.
Just click this link: [Click to add GOLDMINE and CO. to your server](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=239775420470394897&scope=bot&permissions=66321471 "Click to add GOLDMINE to your server!"), select a server, click **Done**, and you're all set! Easy as pie :)

You might want to set the command prefix for your server.
To do so, simply make sure you're an admin, and type: 
 - `!prefix $` for command prefix, replacing **$** with your desired prefix.

### Manual (Private Instance) (Selfbot mode available)
#### This method is harder to set up. It's also required for selfbot mode.
Simply run `python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt` to install all the basic dependencies of this bot. 
For many more advanced features and speed improvements, use `python3 -m pip install -U -r full_requirements.txt` (this doesn't work on Windows!).
For as much as you can get on Windows, use `python3 -m pip install -U -r win_requirements.txt`.
**Note: If you're on Windows, replace `python3` with `python` in all the commands!**

The bot will guide you through the setup, such as login.

#### Simply run `python3 goldmine.py` to complete the setup! This works for both bot mode and selfbot mode.
